# **MultiSwitcheroo**

### homebridge-multiswitcheroo
</br>

### User defined multi-switch accessories for http GET requests.

</br>
Useful for lights, A/V systems, home automation, and includes live status polling & parsing custom responses!
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

Ideally, you would use this to set a characteristic, like volume. For example, our config below outlines a single accessory with a mute, high, medium & low switch for a Yamaha receiver's volume.
</br>
</br>

# You can create new switches in the Homebridge ConfigUi now (as of version 2.0), but if you want to do it manually, everything is explained below.

</br>
</br>

Define your `MultiSwitcheroo` with whatever `name` you want to appear as the main switch title in the home app. This is what is visible if left displayed as a single tile (default). The `name` for each switch is what the individual switches should show. Sometimes these transfer to the home app, and sometimes not, so you may have to rename them all once in the home app, but only once. 

Then, set the appropriate `statusUrl` to call for the status at the set `pollingInterval` (default `3000`).

The `statusPattern` is a regular expression string (regex) sought in the response from the server to get an accurate status for each switch (see the `Mute` switch in the `MultiSwitcheroo` config example below for a really good example of a complex pattern where an unknown number is present in the string).

Set the `onUrl` & `offUrl` as appropriate for each switch. Must be the full URL, including `http://` & port.

The `manufacturer`, `model`, `serialNumber`, & `firmwareRevision` are all optional, but it is best to set them. If you do not set them, they will all default to things that will not error in Controller for HomeKit because of duplicate serial numbers if you have multiple devices using the same one. Plus, it's fun to set these with your own stuff anyway, plus I made it super easy for you in the ConfigUI!

Currently only built to support the `GET` http method.

### Standard Switch (`Switcheroo`)
This switch version had to be removed from the plugin to fix the code. If you need a single switch install `homebridge-http-switch` or revert to version 1.0.3 of `homebridge-multiswitcheroo` and it will continue  to work.

If you already had a `Switcheroo` accessory defined & wish to update, simply change the `accessory` type from `Switcheroo` to `HTTP-SWITCH` & change the `pollingInterval` config entry to `pullInterval`, then install the `homebridge-http-switch` plugin and reboot. The switch will continue to work just as before (scenes & automations will need to be rebuilt; sorry about this).

## Tips

  - Make sure specify the full URL in the `statusURL`. (i.e. `"statusUrl" : "http://192.168.0.XXX:2000"`).
  - Must prepend 'http://' to all URLs.
  - Verify your server only uses `GET`. This plugin only does `GET` requests.
  - Use this plugin in a child bridge. It's just better.
  - You can expose multiple switches on the same child bridge, just use the same `_bridge` `username` & `port` in the config.
  - Name your child bridge using `name` under bridge settings. Defining multple switches will cause this to look bad so fix it in the config.

## Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install homebridge-multiswitcheroo using: `npm install -g homebridge-multiswitcheroo`
    *  if in `hb-shell` environment use: `hb-service add homebridge-multiswitcheroo`
4. Update your `config.json` file or add swithces using plugin settings in the Homebridge ConfigUI.


### This plugin was originally generated with a lot of help from ChatGPT, but i have since re-written it.
