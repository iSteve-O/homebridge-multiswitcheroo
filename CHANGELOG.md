# Changelog
## [3.0.2] - 2023-09-06
### Fixed
- Added check for valid config before creating switches.


## [3.0.1] - 2023-08-23
### Fixed
- Changed how status polling works to update switch status even when server status has not changed.
- Minor errors in README.md corrected.


## [3.0.0] - 2023-08-21
### Added
- Ability to set `firmwareVersion` in the config.
- Proper error, warning & debug logging (almost).

### Changed
- Removed unnecessary & outdated `require` dependancy. Should clear some install warnings.
- Changed from using deprecated `request` to `axios` for http requests.
- Fixed status polling so each accessory's `statusUrl` is called only once to update all switch statuses, instead of calling once for each switch at the `pollingInterval`.
- Version 3.0 uses about 75% less CPU & 15% less memory, on average, than even v2.0 (based on `top`)!

- Added ability to create `MultiSwitcheroo` accessories in the ConfigUI.

### Fixed
- Error logging is better now
